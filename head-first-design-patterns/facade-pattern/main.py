# So ive used this pattern alot already, examples are like the calculator app 
# where you make all the functions for adding subtracting, then you make a function 
# for calling all of those functions depending on the operation you pass in and 
# do the math on the numbers you pass with it.
#
# Another example is the features from the ai competition box I made. I had functions 
# for all the features and then used the facade to create all features at once 
# instead of calling them all separatly. 
#
# I had no idea I was using the facade pattern, but this one comes pretty naturally
# to me.
